# Question/ Need:

I plan to use regression analysis to predict how many points an NBA player will score in their carrer given a set of features for each player.

# Data Description:

I will scrape https://www.nba.com/stats/alltime-leaders/ for the top 1,315 (total # of players I have access to on the page) scorers in NBA history. 
I will also scrape for additioinal information from each players carrer stats link.

# Tools: 

I will be using Python, Beautiful Soup, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Statsmodels, and maybe Selenium.
Other Regression tools.

# MVP Goal:

Do some regression analysis on the data and gain inference into what features contribute to how many points an NBA player will score in their carrer.
