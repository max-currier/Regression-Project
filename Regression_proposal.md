Question/ Need:

I plan to use regression analysis to predict how many points an NBA player will score in their carrer given a set of features for each player.

Data Description:

I will scrape the Wikipedia page "List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders" for the top 50 scorers in NBA history. 
I will also scrape for additioinal information form each players personal Wikipedia page.

Tools:

I will be using Python, Beautiful Soup, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Statsmodels, and maybe Selenium.
Other Regression tools.

MVP Goal:

For the top 50 NBA scorers, gather 10 usable factors that cane be used in regression analysis.
